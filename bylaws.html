                    <h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
                    THE KNOXVILLE REGION INDIAN ORIGIN PHYSICIANS ASSOCIATION (KRIPA) was formed to address a need for cohesive action on the part of physicians, dentists and other medical scientists of Indian origin, residing in Knoxville and neighboring areas.
